# ka-breakthrough-audio

LONG story ahead.

---

so i was trying to port osomp (1.0 public beta soon) to khan academy (no reason in particular) 
and i just couldnt get anything to load. i even tried importing the raw base64 texts of the song and art
but it just wouldn't play. i did however get to load an audio element :)

took me like 3 hours to find a solution. then out of nowhere <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/song-player-warriyo-mortals-feat-laura-brehm-ncs-release/6431239874985984">THIS</a> project popped up. still trying to figure it out rn tho
